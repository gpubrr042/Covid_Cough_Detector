Dataset used : https://github.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Data 

Each folder contains metadata and recordings corresponding to a person. The audio recordings are in wav format (44.1KHz).

Voice samples collected include breathing sounds (fast and slow), cough sounds (deep and shallow), phonation of sustained vowels (/a/ as in made, /i/,/o/), and counting numbers at slow and fast pace. Metadata information collected includes the participant's age, gender, location (country, state/ province), current health status (healthy/ exposed/ cured/ infected) and the presence of comorbidities (pre-existing medical conditions).
